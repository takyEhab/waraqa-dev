              Details: You will receive an e-invoice every 30 days via your
              registered email. This invoice will assess the cost of anticipated
              sessions in the upcoming month based on your current schedule. Any
              canceled lessons may be rescheduled on alternate days. If you
              prefer not to reschedule, the extra payment will be applied to the
              next month’s classes. No additional invoices will be issued until
              you have exhausted payments already made. When to make the
              payment? Except for the first invoice, all payments are made
              monthly in advance. The first invoice will be issued after you
              have indicated satisfaction with the first lesson with your
              assigned teacher. Transfer fees: We add a maximum fee of $5.00 USD
              on the total amount of each invoice, regardless of the amount you
              send. This charge covers the PayPal usage fees that all parties
              incur in making and accepting payment. Your invoice will show
              total hours at $10 USD per hour plus the transfer fee: 15 hours X
              $10 = $150 + $5 = ( $155 Total ) You may make early payments using
              one of our approved payment methods, such as PayPal, or you may
              request an early payment invoice. Late Payments: Payment is due
              within two days of the date of invoice. If an invoice is overdue,
              our team will contact you at least three times before putting
              classes on hold. If you fail to pay any amounts within one two
              days of the date of invoice, Waraqa has the right to apply Late
              Fees on each payment that is due but not received. For the
              avoidance of doubt, Late Fees will not be applied until you have
              received at least three (3) contacts regarding late payment from a
              Waraqa team member. We may, at our sole discretion, reasonably
              delay the application of, or waive wholly or partly, any Late Fee.
              If Late Fees are or may be incurred as a result of Waraqa’s error,
              please let us know, and we will waive or refund any such fees. We
              will contact you as soon as we can to let you know you have missed
              a payment, and to discuss how the payment can be made. Please do
              not proceed with your booking if you believe you cannot afford the
              payments now or will not be able to in the future. Please contact
              us to discuss alternative schedules that may meet your needs. Any
              payment received will be applied to the oldest outstanding payment
              e.g. if your second and third payments are outstanding and you
              make a payment to us, it will be applied to the second repayment
              in full. Any money remaining once the second payment has been
              settled in full will be applied to your third repayment. Class
              Cancellation/Refunds It is your responsibility to notify Waraqa if
              you intend to cancel classes. All requests MUST be sent to the
              Whatsapp group at least 3 hours before the lesson/s begin. In this
              case you will be eligible for rescheduling the canceled class.
              When teachers experience excessive cancellations or late
              cancellations, the institution is unable to allocate new students
              for them to compensate for the cancellations. The cancellation
              policy provides flexibility to our students without compromising
              teachers’ schedules as follows: Eligibility is determined as
              follows: 1- If a teacher cancels a lesson, students will not be
              charged any fees for the canceled class. 2- If a student cancels a
              lesson 3 hours or more before the lesson start-time, he can
              reschedule up to 50% of their total registered monthly hours
              respectively. For example, if a student is registered for 8 hours
              per month and cancels 5 hours, the student will receive credit for
              4 hrs (50% of the 8) and no credit for the 5th hour as it exceeded
              the 50% rule. Unless we are notified by you that a lesson needs to
              be canceled, our teachers will be ready and well prepared waiting
              for you on time Insha Allah. Unless you cancel lessons within the
              terms of this Payment and Cancellation Policy, you will remain
              liable to us for the full payment of service, in accordance with
              your Payment Schedule. If you are unable to make payments due to
              financial hardship, please contact us to initiate a conversation
              with one of our representatives.
